ParticleVis is a visualization tool specialized for loading and exploring particulate simulation data.  It contains a set of features that enables powerful and useful visualizations of particle simulations to be quickly generated.  Support is provided for visualization of hundreds of thousands of particles on commodity workstations, using OpenGL.  Functionality includes data exploration, debugging of simulation output, and generation of presentation-quality imagery.
> The ability to visualize vector flow information in a variety of forms, such as arrow-lines, inscribed glyphs, and motion blurred particles, is particularly useful in the study of granular flows.  User-generated information can be integrated into the visualization using features such as per-particle color maps and surface maps, per-region vector fields, and volumetric data.
